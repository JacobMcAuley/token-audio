# Token Audio

Allows for you to assign ambient sounds to tokens.

# Description

Token audio allows for you to use the default ambient sound workflow but with a twist! If you drag (or create) an ambient sound on top of a token, the ambient sound will follow along!

## Note

For the time there are some minor restrictions/inconviences

1. Tokens can only have one audio source at a time, if you wish to replace an audio source you must delete it.
2. Audio sources can not be easily swapped at this time, if you wish to remove an audio source/replace it you must delete the ambient source and create a new one.

### Usage

1. Create an ambient sound via the HUD on the left hand side.
2. Drag the ambient sound to the center of a token and watch as the ambient sound follows the token.
